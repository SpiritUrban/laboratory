Problem: If you can not make commit file bigger 100mb to GitHub.
Solution: You should use "Git Large File Storage (LFS)".


1.To install "Git Large File Storage (LFS)":
> apt install git-lfs                           

2.To add large file to LFS:
> git lfs track "Uweb.data.gz"

3.Next Just Commit.



To add many files to LFS > (git lfs track "*.bin")



If you want to make a commit through the terminal:

> git add bigfile.bin
> git commit -m "Add large file"
> git push origin main
